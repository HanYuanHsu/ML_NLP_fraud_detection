# ML_NLP_fraud_detection
This is the machine learning project done in Berkeley's stat 154 class. My teamates and I designed a random forest model, an SVM, and a gradient boosting model to classify
authentic job postings versus fraudulent ones. 

The full process of buiding these models and final results can be found in `hhh`.
